Okay, so it’s not 100%.\\nWell, scientists never like to say 100%.\\nCall it 70% and let’s just move on.\\nBut it’s not even close to 70%.\\nYou cannot go around saying to people that there’s 100% chance that they’re gonna die.\\n[chuckling] You know?

It’s my ex-wife’s house.\\nCan we make that happen?\\nYou and Shelly have a great relationship. Stop.\\nYou need to stop.\\nI will, but in all fairness, I actually paid for the house.\\n[Brie] I’m so sorry.\\nI’m sorry, are we not being clear?\\nWe’re trying to tell you that the entire planet is about to be destroyed.\\n[Jack] Okay, um…\\n[Brie] Well, it’s, you know…\\nIt’s something we do around here. We just keep the bad news light.\\nRight. It helps the medicine go down.\\nSpeaking of medicine, tomorrow we’ve got…\\nWell, maybe the destruction of the entire planet isn’t supposed to be fun.\\nMaybe it’s supposed to be terrifying.\\nAnd unsettling.\\n[Adul] No, please don’t do that.\\nAnd you should stay up all night…\\n[Adul] Please.\\n…every night crying, when we’re all 100% for sure gonna fucking die!\\n[crying]\\nHey, Kate.\\n[Kate] I’m sorry.\\nHey, man.\\nMy brother has bipolar disorder. So if you ever need anyone to talk…\\nUh… [inhales sharply]\\nOkay.\\nIs she always like that?\\nI…\\n[Brie] Something I said?\\n[Jack and Brie chuckle]\\n[Jack] Right?\\nMaybe I should have given her that extra Xanax that I had.\\n[Jack and Brie chuckle]\\nListen, if you don’t have enough, we all have enough around here for her.\\nA spoonful of Xanax makes the medicine go down, right?\\n[Jack] That’s right. That’s good.\\nWe’re gonna have to get you back.\\n[Jack] I knew I’d like this guy.\\nIs he a plant? [laughing]\\n[Jack] I knew it.\\n[Brie] Okay.\\nWell, the handsome astronomer can come back anytime, but the yelling lady, not so much.\\n[Jack] Not so much.

Thanks, Billy.\\nUh, we usually get drinks at Aundrine’s after our five o’clock staff meeting.\\nYou know, it’s fun. You should come.\\nOh, I’ll have to see. Thank you for the invitation. Thank you.\\nMmm-hmm.\\nKate? Kate?\\nHey. You were awesome.\\nOh, thanks.\\nCan I get a photo of you for my portfolio?\\nYeah, sure.\\nThanks.\\n[camera clicks]\\nThank you.\\n[woman] You can see this spike here is when Riley Bina asked to take DJ Chello back on the segment before you.\\nWe saw engagement across all social media platforms.\\nHmm. And what about our story?\\n[woman] Randall and Kate, your TV appearance got some nice traffic when Miss Dibiasky cursed.\\nBut, unfortunately, there was an immediate backlash that quickly became a meme.\\n[Kate gasps]\\nOh, Jesus.\\nOh, that’s terrible.\\nThey just think I’m crazy.\\nI mean, look at that.

There’s no response.\\nThere’s absolutely no… Why aren’t people terrified?\\nWhat do we have to say? What do we have to do?\\nThere are scientists in Mexico and Spain who are currently going through the data, and, uh, South Korea has expressed…\\nThat’s great. South Korea.\\nHey.\\nLet us not bullshit each other.\\nThe bottom line is, you guys told us the science was 100%.\\nIt’s not. Now we look like idiots.\\nNo. Who said the science is not 100%?\\nExcuse me?\\nI wanna talk to this person. You tell me who said the science…\\nDr. Jocelyn Calder, the head of NASA, just came out calling it “more near-miss hysteria.”\\nShe’s the one who told us not to say anything.\\n“More near-miss hysteria.”\\nIs she even an astronomer?\\nShe’s the head of NASA, but maybe she doesn’t know what she’s talking about.\\nShe’s the head of NASA, but look, she’s a “former anesthesiologist and a President Orlean super donor.”\\nLet’s not be dramatic here.\\nIt’s all corrupt.\\nYes, but the point is that Adul’s right. There’s still serious debate.\\nAnd now the Herald has egg on its face.\\nWe’ve taken that story as far as it goes.\\nLadies, gentlemen, I wish you a very pleasant end of times.\\n[Mindy] It’s not a goddamn story, okay?\\nWe have precisely six months, ten days, two hours, 11 minutes and 41 seconds, until a comet twice the size of Chicxulub tears through our atmosphere and extincts all life on Earth.\\n[chuckles] When did you do those calculations?\\nI put the moment of impact on a diet app.\\nSo, impact is when my diet ends.\\nOnly I’m not on a diet.

Is that why you aborted this entire mission, is because you’re trying to mine the comet for rare minerals?\\n[Orlean] I think we should hold all questions until the end of the presentation, and you might find that your questions are answered.\\nYes, Madam President.\\nWhen you… When the other metals are factored in, the comet actually contains almost $140 trillion worth of assets.\\n[Jason] Buck-forty trilli.\\n[Orlean] Yeah…\\n[laughter]\\nWhat do these trillions of dollars even matter if we’re all gonna die…\\n[woman] I was about to ask the same question, Janie.\\nWhy weren’t we consulted?\\nAll due respect, Madam President…\\nOh, no!

That…\\nWhat did you say?\\nI wanna know if you’re…\\nDid you call me a businessman?\\nYou do own a corporate…\\nYou think I’m just a businessman?\\nDo you think you know me, Doctor?\\nBusiness?\\nThis is evolution.

So, Randall, we’re hearing that there is no comet, or that there is a comet but it’s a good thing or maybe it’s a bad thing.\\nWe are so confused. [chuckles]\\nSo, could you please help us out here, you know, oh, wise scientist?\\nWell, first and foremost, Brie, um…\\n[sniffs] …there most certainly is a comet.\\n[Brie] All right.\\nAnd we know that there is a comet because we have the data.\\nUm… [clears throat]\\nThere has been growing concern within the scientific community as of late.\\nYou see, the peer-review process is absolutely essential…\\nIf BASH’s stock…\\n…for us to get to the facts of… Yes?\\nIf BASH’s stock is any indicator, we don’t have to worry about the peer review.\\nIt is going gangbusters.\\nAnd full disclosure.

How do we fix it?\\nWe should have deflected this comet when we had the fucking chance, but we didn’t do it. I don’t know why we didn’t do it.\\nAnd now they’re actually firing scientists like me for speaking out, for opposing them.\\nAnd I’m sure many of the people out there aren’t even gonna listen to what I just said ’cause they have their own political ideology, but I… assure you, I am not on one side or the other.\\nI’m just telling you the fucking truth.\\nThis would be a good time to establish that Isherwell and the president have both said that there’s benefits to be…\\nRight, well, the president of the United States is fucking lying!\\nLook, I’m just like all of you.\\nI hope to God, I hope to God that this president knows what she’s doing.\\nI hope she’s got us all taken care of, but the truth is, I think this whole administration has completely lost their fucking mind!\\nAnd I think we’re all gonna die!\\n[breathing heavily]\\n[softly] Look, I just wanna go home.\\n[sighs] I just wanna go home.\\nI just wanna go home more than anything.\\n[breathing heavily]\\nBut if there is one thing, one thing that I pray…\\nThat I pray that all of you hear from what I have just said, is that all of us, all of us…\\n[car door opens]\\n[sighs]\\nWhy’d you do that?\\nI really liked you and I despise most people.\\n[Mindy] You know, I… I really thought I loved you.\\nReally?\\nWow.\\n[sighs] That’s wild.\\nYeah.\\n[car door opens]\\n[man] Ma’am, you need to go.
